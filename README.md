# student-pizza-problem

### Problem Statement
The students can study only while eating pizza. Each student executes the following loop:
    while (true) {
        pick up a slice of pizza;
        study while eating the pizza
    }
    
If a student finds that the pizza is gone, the student goes to sleep until another pizza arrives. 
The first student to discover that the group is out of pizza calls Kamalâ€™s Pizza to order another pizza before
going to sleep. Each pizza has s slices. Once Kamal delivers pizza, he wake up all the students in the
group. Then the students pick up a slice of pizza and go back to studying, and the process continues.
